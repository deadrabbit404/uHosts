### Description
uHosts is a Magisk module and a tool for safeguarding your device against most ads, trackers and malwares. It uses hosts file to redirect harmful traffics to 0.0.0.0. The hosts file variants used by uHosts come from the [1Hosts](https://o0.pages.dev) project which has a collection of hosts lists from various  reputable sources. Credits to [@badmojr](https://github.com/badmojr) for their amazing work.
